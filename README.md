## _An RDF Data Cube for Exploring Among-Country COVID-19 Correlations_

The among-country variation in the numbers of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths per capita is not well-understood. Various hypotheses have been proposed, such as high prevalence of comorbidities, climate, pollution, health services, public policies, etc. While a number of initiatives have explored this variance, or have developed relevant datasets to better understand this variance, there remains uncertainty regarding the factors involved.

### What will you find in this repository?
